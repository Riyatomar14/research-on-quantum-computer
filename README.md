Nobel Laureate Bill Phillips said that using quantum principles to compute is as different as classical computing as a classical supercomputer is from an abacus.

## What is Quantum computing?

Quantum computing is a multidisciplinary field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than on classical computers. The field of quantum computing includes hardware research and application development. Quantum computers are able to solve certain types of problems faster than classical computers by taking advantage of quantum mechanical effects, such as superposition and quantum interference.

## What is the quantum computing advantage?

Currently, no quantum computer can perform a useful task faster, cheaper, or more efficiently than a classical computer. Quantum advantage is the threshold where we have built a quantum system that can perform operations that the best possible classical computer cannot simulate in any kind of reasonable time.for ex:

1.Drug discovery and chemistry in general

2.Heath care and diagnosis to treat cancer

3.era of fraud detection in finance transaction and risk protection

## quantum volume

Quantum volume is a metric that measures the capabilities and error rates of a quantum computer. It expresses the maximum size of square quantum circuits that can be implemented successfully by the computer. The form of the circuits is independent from the quantum computer architecture, but compiler can transform and optimize it to take advantage of the computer's features. Thus, quantum volumes for different architectures can be compared.

## NOTE-The current world record for highest quantum volume as of July 2023 is 2^19, accomplished by Quantinuum's H1-1 20-qubit ion trap quantum computer.

## some quantum base technology is still working-

# 1.IBM and Daimler use quantum computer to develop next-gen batteries

Electric vehicles have an Achilles heel: the capacity and speed-of-charging of their batteries. A quantum computing breakthrough by researchers at IBM and Daimler AG, the parent company of  Mercedes-Benz, could help tackle this challenge. We used a quantum computer to model the dipole moment of three lithium-containing molecules, which brings us one step closer the next-generation lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries that would be more powerful, longer lasting and cheaper than today’s widely used lithium ion batteries.

## NOTE- Quantum computers are not yet better than classical computers. They are very ‘noisy,’ meaning that any outside disturbance knocks the fragile qubits out of quantum states crucial for the calculation too early for them to run meaningful computations. 

# 2.JP Morgan Chase and IBM for finance services industry

use for simpling algorithm,to compute the expected value of a t-bill,showing a quadratic speed-up verses a classical.banking issues like non-performing assets and  loan risk profiling etc.
